Adds a search box to the WooCommerce Product Categories meta box for easier category selection.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Easy Category Select is a simple plugin that enhances the WooCommerce Product Categories meta box on the product edit page by adding a search box at the top. This allows users to quickly filter categories as they type and displays the selected category's position in the category tree (e.g., "Parent > Child > Grandchild").

This plugin is particularly useful for stores with a large number of product categories, making it easier to find and select the right category without scrolling through a long list.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `woocommerce-easy-category-select` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Edit a product in the WordPress admin area to see the search box in the Product Categories meta box.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with all versions of WooCommerce? =
